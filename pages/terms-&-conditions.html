            9. PRICING, AVAILABILITY AND ORDER PROCESSING All prices are listed in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) and are
            inclusive of VAT and are listed on the Site by the seller that is selling the product or service. Items in
            your Shopping Cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on the item's product detail page.
            Please note that this price may differ from the price shown for the item when you first placed it in your
            cart. Placing an item in your cart does not reserve the price shown at that time. It is also possible that
            an item's price may decrease between the time you place it in your basket and the time you purchase it. We
            do not offer price matching for any items sold by any seller on our Site or other websites. We are
            determined to provide the most accurate pricing information on the Site to our users; however, errors may
            still occur, such as cases when the price of an item is not displayed correctly on the Site. As such, we
            reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order. In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own
            discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. We
            shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and
            your prepayment processed. If such a cancellation occurs on your prepaid order, our policies for refund will
            apply. Please note that BITM posses 100% right on the refund amount. Usually refund amount is calculated
            based on the customer paid price after deducting any sort of discount and shipping fee. We list availability
            information for products listed on the Site, including on each product information page. Beyond what we say
            on that page or otherwise on the Site, we cannot be more specific about availability. Please note that
            dispatch estimates are just that. They are not guaranteed dispatch times and should not be relied upon as
            such. As we process your order, you will be informed by e-mail or sms if any products you order turn out to
            be unavailable. Please note that there are cases when an order cannot be processed for various reasons. The
            Site reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason at any given time. You may be asked to
            provide additional verifications or information, including but not limited to phone number and address,
            before we accept the order. In order to avoid any fraud with credit or debit cards, we reserve the right to
            obtain validation of your payment details before providing you with the product and to verify the personal
            information you shared with us. This verification can take the shape of an identity, place of residence, or
            banking information check. The absence of an answer following such an inquiry will automatically cause the
            cancellation of the order within a reasonable timeline. We reserve the right to proceed to direct
            cancellation of an order for which we suspect a risk of fraudulent use of banking instruments or other
            reasons without prior notice or any subsequent legal liability.
